Character Counter Excercise

Requirements
- The character counter should initially display the maximum character limit.
- As the user types, the counter should update to display the remaining number of characters.
If the user exceeds the character limit, the counter should display a negative number (indicating the number of characters over the limit) and prevent further input.
